We present the results of a novel type of numerical simulation that realizes a rotating universe with a shear-free, rigid body rotation in a GÃ¶del-like metric. We run cosmological simulations with various degrees of rotation and compare the results to the analytical expectations of the Einstein--de Sitter and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. To achieve this, we use the StePS N-body code that is capable of simulating the entire infinite universe, overcoming the technical obstacles of classical toroidal (periodic cubical) topologies that would otherwise prevent us from running such simulations. Results show a clear anisotropy between the polar and equatorial expansion rates with up to $2.5$ % deviation from the isotropic case, a considerable effect in the era of precision cosmology.
