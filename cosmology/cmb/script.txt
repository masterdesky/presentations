- Today's topic is the CMB
- Probably everyone in the room heard about it
- Certanly deemed to be one of most important observations/observed effect in
  modern astronomy
- Kinda well-studied because of this and popular target for future observations
- Before the physics I would like to talk about history


#
- At the end of the 19th century, radio was invented
- Long-distance wireless communication is definitely superior
- Nowadays we're well-aware of the benefits of wireless communication
- Back then, people still had to realize that it's quite a neat technology
- Communication technology was heavily boosted by the two world wars in the
  first half of the 20th century
- Due to the size of the conflic zones, reliable and fast communication on the
  frontline was vital to any kind of success
- After the Second World War, R&D still had a lot of momentum
- Many technologies, eg. rocket science was developing with exponential speed
- The launch of Sputnik-1 turned the attention towards orbiting satellites as
  tools for large-distance wireless communication
- Reserachers were working on to utilize not only radio signals, but microwave
  signals too
- One of the ideas proposed by the Bell Laboratories was to use large, reflective
  balloons orbiting the Earth to reflect and "bounce" signals from one point on
  the ground to another off of these balloons. This was Project Echo.
- Two balloons were launched in 1960 and 1964 and two ground stations were
  constructed to test this technology

#
- One of the stations were the Holmdel Horn Antenna in New Jersey, coordinated
  by two gentlemen, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
- During this program, the main task of Penzias and Wilson was to eliminate every
  noise and interference from the receiver of this antenna
- However after their first measurements in 1964, some strange noise still
  remained

#
- This was uniform across the enitre sky and was detectable during every part
  of the day
- Famous anecdote that they thought it could be cause by the pigeons nesting
  inside the antenna, but after cleaning everything up, this noise still remained
- Bernard Burke casually told Penzias about a paper in work at Princeton that
  details how the Big Bang should have left a microwave "echo" of this event,
  referring to as the "cosmic microwave background radiation" (or CMB for short)
- Penzias immediately contacted the authors and after some discussion they
  concluded that the statistical properties of this strange noise closely
  matches the predictions of cosmological theories about the CMB
- Then in 1965 they jointly published their findings about this observation

#
- It still took some time for the CMB to be recignized as an important
  aspect of cosmology
- Although it was first predicted in 1948, it still took almost 30 years for
  this theory to get well established in the general scientific community
- Nowadays we have a plethora of information about this phenomena
- Couple words about why it's so important for modern physics, why it's studied

#
- Just to be concise, here's the history of the universe
- It's not "just the echo of the big bang", but it has an important role in the
  whole story
- Big Bang happens. What's this? Nobody knows. But we have a copious amount of
  coherent observational evidence that it happened.
- After the Big Bang, the universe is doing two things: expanding and cooling
  down
- Because of this, it goes through several transitional epochs that can be
  mostly described using elaborate particle physics
- To our best knowledge, the universe already wasn't homogenous at this point,
  it was filled with "ripples" in the very first stages and those turned into
  various fluctuations in the later, but still early stages
- The early universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation, photons had a
  very short mean free path due to the Thomson scattering in the extremely
  dense medium that filled up the universe
- However around 370,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down to
  a point (around 3000K), where the formation of hydrogene atoms were energetically
  favorable
- At this point the so-called "recombination" of electrons and protons happened,
  were electrons bonded with protons, creating hydrogene atoms.
- Simultaneously, the mean free path of photons grew to infinity, since they
  couldn't scatter on free electrons anymore. They also thermodynamically
  separated from this, now non-existent electron cloud. This event is referred
  to as "decoupling".
- What happened here? This large volume of photons suddenly became free and
  was able to finally propagate through the universe.
- And this burst of photons is what we call as CMB. This is basically a snapshot
  of the universe in the electromagnetic domain, 370,000 years after the Big Bang.
- And this is the universe now, where we have stars, galaxies, galactic clusters,
  filaments and voids, permeating the entire universe.

#
- Okay, but I have to go a bit deeper than that to really understand what we see
  on this strange CMB image.
- We can see two different things on our CMB measurements:
    - The actual photons that bounced off for the last time from an electron
    - The interaction of these photons with other objects in the universe
      during their travel
- The first point here refers to that we can measure the temperature of these
  photons. And we can plot this temperature map for the enitre sky.
- I don't want to speak about the second part now.
#
- We can see on these temperature maps, that they're not homogenous. There are
  many, although small fluctuations on the entire sky.
- Photons decoupled from electrons, when they had a 3000 K temperature
- They "cooled down" to 2.7 K due to the redshift they suffered traveling for
  billions of years in a expanding universe.
- The CMB has a redshift of approximately z=1099
- And now comes the big reveal: to our best understanding and according to our
  current theories about the evolution of the universe, the small ripples in
  the early universe created the fluctuations in the later stages, that we can
  see in the CMB
- And now these fluctuations grew into the large scale structure of the universe
- Now you understand, why it has an important role in cosmology
